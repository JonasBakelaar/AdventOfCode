Part one was a slope checker with an input where # was a tree and . was open snow. The goal was to check how many trees one would hit if they ski'd down a mountain with this configuration of trees to open snow. The input replicated itself horizontally, but was finite vertically. The slope to check was down 1 right 3.

Correct answer for my input: 193

(part two used the same code as part 1 with updated slopes)
Part two was similar, but required checking with these slopes:
    - right 1, down 1
    - right 3, down 1 (already done)
    - right 5, down 1
    - right 7, down 1
    - right 1, down 2

The goal is to then multiply the numbers received and provide the product.
