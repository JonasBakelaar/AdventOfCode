# AdventOfCode2020
These are my solutions to the 2020 Advent Of Code coding challenges.

Each day, a new challenge was released. I aim to complete these challenges when I can.

# Languages Used

I have so far exclusively used Python as I want to use these challenges to get myself aquainted with smaller built in Python utility functions.
I may switch to another language such as Java or Dotnet after Day 10.

# Format

- Each challenge is split into its own folder.
- The description of the challenge, along with my answer for my input, is included in a file called "challenge.txt".
    - This will also include a TLDR because the explanations are a bit long.
- The code itself is split by the parts, labeled as "dayx-part1.py" and "dayx-part2.py".
- The code may not be formatted/commented nicely. However, I've done my best to include my thinking as comments in the code.
